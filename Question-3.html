   <!-- Question-3

            • What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?

        Answer:-
           
            -> CSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible with
        earlier CSS1 and CSS2. The selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors.
        CSS1 AND CSS2 didn't have provision to specifically design the web layout.

            -> CSS3 features the Selector concept, whereas CSS does not. Thus, rather than applying classes or IDs for 
        creating styles, developers can use CSS3 to choose HTML elements in place of IDs and classes as attributes to be
        applied to CSS styles.

            -> There is no difference. Just like HTML and HTML5. CSS3 is simply the newer “version” of CSS which has more 
        advanced features than earlier “releases.” Likewise, HTML5 simply is HTML and CSS3 is simply CSS. Both HTML5 and 
        CSS3 became marketing buzzwords way above and beyond the technologies that they are referring.
